            <i>Hello!</i> I am a science student currently based in the UK.<br><br>

            My academic interest is in biology, and particularly ecology.<br>
            Questions like "<i>How have organisms and ecosystems changed to become what they are today?</i>"
            and "<i>How are they changing and how <strong>will</strong> they change in the future?</i>"
            are what I like to ask and wish to find out answers for.<br>
            The organisms that I spend the most time thinking about are the bryophytes (mosses and liverworts) -
            the plants which many of us are familiar with as being the <i>little green things</i> that grow on rocks, trees
            or some damp soil. They are much stronger and resilient than most people think, because most bryophytes can
            survive drying out completely and apparently 'resurrect' themselves when just a bit of water is dropped on them.
            They are also very beautiful plants, which is why I carry a hand lens with me
            to most places so that I wouldn't miss out on those little, green, growing things around me.<br><br>

            In terms of programming, my projects are usually about simulations and visualisations.
            One of the recurring themes in my work is genetic algorithm, which mimics the process of evolution
            to usually solve optimisation problems. Some things that I've 'evolved' using this include trees,
            'springy' creatures and lampshades; I'm planning to slowly upload some of these old work here.
            Front-end web development is what I mostly do for my projects as of recently, but I have worked in
            Java to develop an Android app and sometimes code in Python for small, computational projects.
            I also have some experience developing full-stack using Node.js or Ruby for the back-end,
            and am currently planning some projects that will involve some server-side coding.
            I'm interested in how code can simulate biological
            processes, and also how programming can connect science with art, and connnect people with, and through, nature.<br><br>

            I also like to draw sometimes, and I usually upload works that I make on the Instagram account
            below. I use iNaturalist to upload observations (of mainly mosses and liverworts), and my profile there
            is also down below.
